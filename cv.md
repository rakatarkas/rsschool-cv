## About me

I'm a new learner in coding. My goals consist in achiving professional skills and be qualified enough for a high-paid position. Having early expierience with IT community is important to me, as to be aknowledge of it when i'll go to college. I want to become the best version of me, to live a better life with the help of coding.  I'm ready to learn new information and seek it if requierd. 

## Skills
For now i know:
* HTML

>I can't say that i know these languages perfectly, but had expirience on working with them.

## Self-study
I learned HTML and CSS by myself, then later practised them as an intern in the facility. Had some work with JavaScript. So far my only edicational sourse is this course, my first time ever with working on something like this.

## English level

I've been studying english for 5-6 years. I didn't have a chance to practise it with native speaker. But according to the test i had passed, my level is around __B2/C1__. At school i always get excellent grades and no problem with wathcing films on english without the subtitles.
