## Self-study
I taught myself HTML and CSS and later applied my skills during an internship at a small programming company. I also possess foundational knowledge of JavaScript. Thus far, this course has been my primary educational resource, marking my first experience working on a project of this nature.

## English level

I have been studying English for 5-6 years, although I have not yet had the opportunity to practice with a native speaker. Based on a proficiency test I completed, my level is approximately __B2/C1__. In school, I consistently achieve excellent grades, and I have no difficulty watching films in English without subtitles.
